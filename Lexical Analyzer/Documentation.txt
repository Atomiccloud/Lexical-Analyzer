To run this program you need to run as a java program with test_file passed as arg0.

This program takes an input file and breaks down the file into 
tokens, operators and keywords. It checks each character and makes sure that
the characters are in the c- language. The output will show any characters
that are not in the language as an error and report everything else as a
keyword, token or just output the operator.
